A number of videos are available for viewing at no charge, and additional material is available on a paid-subscription basis.
                        <br>
While the Expert Connect <a href ="{{url('terms-conditions')}}">Terms of Service</a> in general applies to the Video Library, certain items and issues
are unique to the Video Library. This document presents items and issues that add to, modify or supersede
the general Expert Connect Terms of Service.<br>

                        <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                          Access to the complete Video Library is available with an annually renewed subscription. To subscribe, you
(“Subscriber”) must provide one or more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current, valid,
accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time and which may include payment through
your account with a third party (ex: Apple iTunes). You can update your Payment Methods by going to the
"Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment
service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment
Method(s). You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary
Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain
responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient
funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we
have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you
certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method.
Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

                       <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                         Subscriber has the option to pay for the annual subscription either one of two ways:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-show">
                        <li>12 monthly installment payments</li>
                        <li>Single annual payment</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Depending on the payment plan selected, either the first month’s installment or the total annual payment will be
                        charged to your Payment Method at confirmation of purchase.
                        </p>

                       <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                         This subscription will be automatically renewed annually unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours
before the then current membership period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours before
the end of each annual membership period at the rate and frequency of your selected payment plan.
                        </p>

                       <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                         You can cancel your Subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Video Library
through the end of your annual subscription period. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-year
subscription periods or unwatched video content. To cancel, go to the "Account" page on our website and
follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your subscription, your account will automatically close at the end of your current subscription period. If you subscribed for the Video Library using your account with a
third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your subscription, you may need to do so through that
third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or
unsubscribing from the Video Library through that third party. You may also find billing information about your
video Library by visiting your account with the applicable third party.

                         We reserve the right to change our subscription plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components
thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as
otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Service, any price changes or changes to your subscription
plan will take effect following notice to you, and will not be effective before the end of a subscriber’s then-
current subscription period.

                         Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used subscriptions. Following any
cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Video Library through the end of your current
subscription period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration
to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide
them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to
credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any
circumstance.
