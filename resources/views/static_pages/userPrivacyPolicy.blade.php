                        and subscribers on any Social Networking Services you have enabled will be able to view such activity.

                        Please note that if you exercise the choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but
                        it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.

                        Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that
                        enable us to, among other things: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii)
                        understand the web pages of the Site you have visited; (iv) enhance your user experience by delivering and
                        measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and
                        analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. They are then returned to the original
                        website on each subsequent visit or to any other website that recognizes them. The term "Cookie" is used in
                        this Notice in the broad sense to include all similar techniques and technology, including web beacons, tracking
                        pixels, and log files. For more information on these additional tools, see our glossary below.

                              We use temporary Cookies on all of our secure pages to assign and register a session ID. This identifier is also
                        used for internal reporting purposes. It does not allow us to identify you personally by name and this type of 
                        Cookie does not leave any information recoverable on your hard drive. Most of our proprietary Cookies fall into
                        this category and expire when you close your Internet browser.

                        Our first-party Cookies and third-party Cookies are permanent Cookies. They allow us to understand visitors'
                        browsing behavior over a longer period of time or to provide you with additional features related to your Site
                        customization requests and the content that you have saved or stored. They can stay on your computer for 24
                        hours, a week or several years, depending on their function. This means that these Cookies survive after your
                        browser is closed and can be used by our Site to recognize your computer when you re-open your browser
                        later.

                        We only place Cookies on your device after you give us permission. If you do not want to receive some of the
                        categories of Cookies used on our Site, you can use the means described below to disable them. Note,
                        however, that we will still need to set a Cookie on your device to remember your preferences when you visit
                        our Site again from a single browser.
                        At the moment, it is technically impossible for you to synchronize your settings between your browsers and
                        your devices (your computer or your smartphone). You must set them on each browser/device that you
                        currently use and each time you use a new browser or device.
                        You can decide whether to accept or reject Cookies. You can exercise your Cookie preferences by managing
                        Cookies from your web browser. As the means by which to activate or deactivate Cookies varies from one web
                        browser to another, you should visit your web browser's help menu for more information on Cookie
                        preferences. You can also configure your browser at any time to be notified of the receipt of a Cookie, so that
                        you can decide whether you want to accept it or not. Cookies do not under any circumstances read the data
                        from your hard drive and you can delete them from your computer at any time.

                        Cookies are text files that contain information and are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when
                        you visit a website. They are then returned to the original website each subsequent visit or to any other website
                        that recognizes them.
                        Log files are Web server files (storing information such as domain names or IP addresses, URLs, the http
                        response code, the website from which you access ours and/or the date and length of your visit) that are
                        created automatically when a user visits a site.
                        Some pages of our website contain web beacons (also known as "Internet beacons," "web beacons" or
                        "invisible GIFs"). A web beacon is an electronic image usually composed of a single pixel. It can be placed on
                        a web page or in an email to transmit information, including personal data such as the IP address of the
                        computer that downloaded the page in question, the URL of the page, the time of consultation of the page and
                        the type of browser used, as well as the data contained in the cookies sent by a third party.
