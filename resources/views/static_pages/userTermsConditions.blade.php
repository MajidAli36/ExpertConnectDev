                        You can rate an Expert’s services in our Application and you agree to be rated by an Expert who provides services
                        to you. You may dispute your ratings. However, it will be in Expert Connect’s sole and absolute discretion to
                        change, edit, or remove your ratings. You understand and acknowledge that your ratings will affect your future

                        All service sessions maybe monitored or recorded to guard against users’ solicitation of business which is
                        prohibited by Expert Connect on the Application. If any such solicitation is found, you agree to pay [$100,000] to
                        Expert Connect as liquidated damages. You agree that it is very costly for Expert Connect to enforce this provision
                        and is not practical for Expert Connect to calculate or estimate the damages for users’ violation of this provision.
                        You therefore agree that the amount set forth in this provision is reasonable to compensate Expert Connect for its
                        suffered damages.

Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (nonclass, nonrepresentative) basis.

                                <br>
                                Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.
                                The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879 FREE. The use of the word “arbitrator” in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration: rather, the AAA’s rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.<br>
                                A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice describing the nature of the dispute in reasonable detail (“Notice”). The Notice to Expert Connect should be sent to Expert Connect LLC, at [address of Expert Connect LLC]. Expert Connect will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your Expert Connect account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.
                                <br>
                                If you and Expert Connect are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or Expert Connect may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to Expert Connect at the following address: Expert Connect LLC, [address of Expert Connect LLC]. In the event Expert Connect initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your Expert Connect account. Any settlement offer made by you or Expert Connect shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
                                The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Expert Connect may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Expert Connect subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Expert Connect may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.<br>
                                The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Expert Connect user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

                                <br>
                                Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, Expert Connect will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by Expert Connect should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and Expert Connect will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Expert Connect for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Expert Connect on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.
